## Petal Effect Biomimicry Applications Lattice

1. High-Adhesion Surfaces: Anti-drip coatings → cryogenic lines, battery cooling (prevent accumulation)
   Benefit: Controlled condensate in zero-g / humid Mars

2. Directional Transport: Anisotropic pillars → microfluidic chips, drug delivery
   Advantage: Passive one-way flow without pumps

3. Anti-Fogging: Pinning droplets → optics, displays, helmets (no film coalescence)
   Extension: Optimus visor, Starship windows

4. Switchable Adhesives: Petal + dry adhesion → grippers (wet pin, dry release)
   Application: Orbital assembly, delicate manipulation

5. Textiles: Moisture-pinning fabrics → performance wear (sweat beads, evaporates)
   Application: Powrush™ skins, outdoor gear
